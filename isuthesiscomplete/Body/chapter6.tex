General hypothesis that bow echoes are less predictable, and this is the cause of poor skill in Snively

\section{Predictability of bow echoes}

Paper 1 - probably less predictable, as IC/LBC improvement wouldn't help and MP didn't show systematic deficiency
Paper 2 - sensitive to grid spacing is worrying
Additional findings - prog less predictable than serial, and not related to NAM skill, GEFS spread.

Butterflies and bow echoes - sum the link.

\section{Solutions}
Ensembles must be prioritised
Emphasis on stochastic schemes

\section{Future work}
Is paper 2 acceleration general with SKEB and \dx?
Additional work - finding a better link
