\chapter{The relationship between synoptic and storm-scale predictability of mesoscale convection systems.}

Synoptic and storm-scale predictability of MCSs, particularly bow echoes

\section{Introduction}

Outline regarding predictability
Lyapunov
Anthes/forcing

Stensrud etc stuff about how larger spread means less predictable
Lyapunov might be higher with troughs but forcing is stronger

\section{Data and Methods}

ECMWF
GEFS
NAM
Snively database
RUC boxes

\section{Results}

Prog less predictable than serial

NAM skill vs Snively score
GEFS spread vs Snively score
NAM skill vs GEFS spread

(Below all init loc/time vs bowing loc/time)
Lyapunov?
Temp 700/850
RH 700/850?
